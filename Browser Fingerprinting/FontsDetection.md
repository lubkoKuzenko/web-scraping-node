# Fonts fingerprinting

## WHAT IS THIS?

Fonts installed on a user's device can be detected using JavaScript and CSS techniques. The list of installed fonts can provide a unique identifier, as different users may have different fonts installed or may use different default fonts based on their operating system and browser.

## sHOW IS THIS USED IN YOUR FINGERPRINT?

The list of fonts you have installed on your machine is generally consistent and linked to a particular operating system. If you install just one font which is unusual for your particular browser, this can be a highly identifying metric.
