# HTTP Headers fingerprinting

## WHAT IS THIS?

HTTP headers are sent by the browser during a web request and can provide valuable information for fingerprinting. Some commonly analyzed headers include:

- User-Agent: Provides information about the browser, operating system, and device.
- Accept-Language: Indicates the user's preferred language.
- Accept-Encoding: Reveals supported content encodings.
- Do-Not-Track: Indicates the user's preference for tracking.
